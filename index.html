      "Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement"
      Progressive enhancement is an approach to web development that prioritizes accessibility and graceful degradation of web content across different devices, platforms, and user abilities. The idea is to start with a basic, lightweight version of a website or application that can be accessed by all users regardless of their device or technology constraints. Then, additional features and functionalities are added in layers or modules that build upon the basic version, but are only available to users who have the necessary technology or capabilities.
      Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it aligns with the principles of accessibility, inclusivity, and sustainability. By prioritizing the basic version of a website or application, developers ensure that everyone can access and use the content, regardless of their device or assistive technology. This is particularly important for users with disabilities, who may rely on assistive technology to access web content. Additionally, by adding advanced features and functionalities as optional modules, developers avoid creating a one-size-fits-all solution that may be too heavy or complex for some users.
      Moreover, progressive enhancement allows for a more sustainable approach to web development. Instead of constantly adding new features and functionalities to keep up with the latest trends, developers can focus on creating a solid foundation that can adapt and evolve over time. This reduces the amount of technical debt, maintenance, and cost associated with web development.
